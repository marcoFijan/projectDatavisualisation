# Project Datavisualisation - Dashboard for Ring Ring

For the project Datavisualisation I have to create an interactive visualisation for a company. I have chosen for Ring Ring. Ring Ring is a company that specializes in bikingtrafic. Ring Ring wants to promote biking and does this with an app. People can use the app and track their route that they biked. I have to create an interactive visualisation that the stakeholders can use to visualize that data

# Concept

For this project I have made several concepts with my visual teammates, Jean Paul Oppelaar and Tugce Tansel. If you want to take a look at the concepts, you can do so by navigating to [my wiki](https://github.com/marcoFijan/projectDatavisualisation/wiki)
